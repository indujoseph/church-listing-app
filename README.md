# church-listing-app
This app is a church listing website. It will display a list of churches and, when a user selects a church, show its specific details. This will be a full-stack application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It will be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a clean, intuitive, and highly responsive user interface. Key features will include:

* Church list: A scrollable list of churches with key information.

* Church details page: Displays detailed information for a selected church, including location, mass timings, announcements, and a list of priests.

* Navigation: Simple and clear navigation, likely a single-page flow or a bottom navigation bar for mobile.

The backend will be an API server built with Node.js and the Express framework. It will handle data requests from the React frontend. It will:

* Serve data: Provide church data, including all the requested details.

* Manage endpoints: Create specific API endpoints for fetching all churches and a single church by its ID.

* Host the application: Serve the React static files in a production environment.
